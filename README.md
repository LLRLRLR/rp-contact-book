Guided project where i learned the basics of databases using SQlite and GUI Programming using PyQt5.
Learning Objectives:
- Better Understanding of OOP i.e Class Inheritance, static methods
- MVC how to structure files and how each componets links together
- why we use __name__ == __main__
- Basic sql syntax which is not that hard.

Views are responsible for displaying the data to the user and also for providing editable widgets to allow the user to modify the data directly in the view.
Models communicate with and access the data in the database. Any change in a model updates the database immediately.
